            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I started to familiarize with computers in primary school and it is fantastic to see how much and how fast it has changed in a relatively short periode of time. Since 5<sup>th</sup> grade in school the computer and the internet was always a necassity. <em>For work and for study.</em> I would like to say that I am glad that I can improve and enhance my knowledge in this enormous realm. It is also great that in this school it is possible to meet many people from many different cultures. And it started with <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
            <p>With this course, I really hope that it will be possible to use the skills in various fields as the creative side as well as the technical skills we learn during the two years in this course. All the classes are starting to be mostly interactive and that helps to use the freshly learned skills and practice our communication skills as well.</p>
